# dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles, including an install script for everything I use in MacOS.

## Installation

```zsh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrpsc/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/.install.sh | zsh
```

## To Do/Fix

[ ] Make install script executable
[ ] Make sure to run script with sudo
[ ] Make sure to have a ssh key setup for github or use https to clone directory
[ ] Make sure to set up nvm by creating .nvm directory and installing node
[ ] Make sure to clone powerlevel10k repo into `.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes`
[ ] Figure out why moving the .config directory doesn't work
[ ] Figure out why moving the other directories and files doesn't work
[ ] Fix oh-my-zsh plugins by making sure to clone zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting into `.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
